Let's reset. I will provide you with one final, clean `compose.yaml` file. This is the most standard and robust configuration for this setup. I will also provide a "full reset" procedure to clean up any broken or stuck components on your server that may be causing these issues.

Please follow these steps in order.

### The Plan: A Full System Reset and the Final Configuration

**The Goal:** To remove any old, broken, or conflicting Docker components from your system and then start fresh with a single, correct configuration.

**Step 1: Full and Complete Docker Cleanup**

Run these commands on your `mynas` server (`192.168.1.60`). This will stop everything and perform a deep cleaning of Docker.

1.  Navigate to your project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ~/nextcloud-aio
    ```
2.  Tear down any existing services and remove orphaned containers:
    ```bash
    docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
    ```
3.  Prune the Docker system. This is a powerful command that removes all unused containers, networks, and images. It's a great way to get a clean slate.
    ```bash
    docker system prune -af
    ```
4.  Restart the Docker service itself. This forces it to rebuild its internal networking rules from a clean state.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```

**Step 2: Create the Final `compose.yaml`**

Delete the entire contents of your current `compose.yaml` file. Replace it with this **exact and final version**. Do not mix and match with previous versions.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

# This creates a dedicated network for our containers to communicate on.
networks:
  nextcloud-network:
    name: nextcloud-network

services:
  # Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) will handle all web traffic and SSL.
  nginx-proxy-manager:
    image: 'docker.io/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest'
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: nginx-proxy-manager
    ports:
      # Exposes web ports to your host machine.
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      # Exposes the NPM admin UI port.
      - "81:81"
    volumes:
      - ./npm/data:/data
      - ./npm/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
    # Attaches NPM to our dedicated network.
    networks:
      nextcloud-network:
        # This is the key: it makes NPM respond to your domain name inside Docker.
        aliases:
          - nasmj.duckdns.org

  # Nextcloud All-in-One (AIO) master container.
  nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer:
    image: ghcr.io/nextcloud-releases/all-in-one:latest
    init: true
    restart: always
    container_name: nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer
    # This ensures NPM starts before AIO.
    depends_on:
      - nginx-proxy-manager
    volumes:
      - nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    ports:
      # Only the AIO interface port needs to be exposed for initial setup.
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      # The internal port that AIO will run the Nextcloud apache service on.
      APACHE_PORT: 11000
      # Trusts requests coming from any container on the Docker network.
      NC_TRUSTED_PROXIES: 172.16.0.0/12
      # Below are your custom settings from before.
      NEXTCLOUD_DATADIR: /mnt/ncdata
      NEXTCLOUD_UPLOAD_LIMIT: 1028G
      NEXTCLOUD_MAX_TIME: 7200
      NEXTCLOUD_MEMORY_LIMIT: 4096M
      TALK_PORT: 3478
    # Attaches AIO to the same dedicated network as NPM.
    networks:
      - nextcloud-network

volumes:
  nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:
    name: nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer
```

**Step 3: Configure Nginx Proxy Manager**

This step **must** be done after the containers are running. The settings must match the `compose.yaml` file.

1.  In your `~/nextcloud-aio` directory, start the stack:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
2.  Log in to Nginx Proxy Manager at `http://192.168.1.60:81`.
3.  Edit your `nasmj.duckdns.org` proxy host.
4.  Set the forwarding details to **exactly this**:
    * **Forward Hostname / IP:** `nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer` (The service name of the Nextcloud AIO container)
    * **Forward Port:** `11000` (The `APACHE_PORT` you set in the environment)
    * Ensure **Websockets Support** is enabled.
5.  Save the changes.

### What to Expect

This procedure provides the most robust, standard, and self-contained configuration. It also cleans up any underlying issues with your Docker environment.

After following all of these steps, please check the Nextcloud Admin Overview page.

If the setup warnings *still* persist with the long delay, it means there is a fundamental networking issue with your `mynas` host operating system, its kernel, or the Proxmox virtualization environment that is preventing Docker from functioning correctly. This is beyond what can be fixed in a `compose.yaml` file.

I am confident that this full reset and final configuration gives you the best possible chance of success.
