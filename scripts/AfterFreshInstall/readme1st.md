Proxmox Post-Installation Automation Script



How to Use the Script
Log In to Proxmox: Access your Proxmox server's shell, either directly with a monitor and keyboard or via SSH.

Create the Script File: Use a text editor like nano to create the script file.

````Bash
nano proxmox-setup.sh
````
Paste the Code: Copy the entire script from the document above and paste it into the nano editor.

Save and Exit: Press Ctrl + X, then Y, and finally Enter to save the file and exit nano.

Make the Script Executable: Grant the script execute permissions.

````Bash
chmod +x proxmox-setup.sh
````
Run the Script: Execute the script using sudo to ensure it has the necessary root permissions.

````Bash
sudo ./proxmox-setup.sh
````
The script will now run, pausing at each major step to explain what it's doing and ask for your confirmation before proceeding. Just follow the on-screen prompts.
