>[!NOTE]
>Bash script that automates the process of changing your Proxmox server's IP address.

This script will:
* Prompt you for the new IP address (with CIDR) and the new gateway.
* Automatically detect the old IP address and network configuration file.
* Show you the proposed changes before making them.
* Ask for your confirmation before writing the changes to the system files.
* Modify both `/etc/network/interfaces` and `/etc/hosts`.
* Offer to reboot the server to apply the changes.

### The Bash Script: `change-proxmox-ip.sh`

You can create a file named `change-proxmox-ip.sh` on your Proxmox server and paste the code below into it.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#
# This script automates changing the static IP address, gateway, and /etc/hosts
# file on a Proxmox VE server. It must be run with root privileges.

# over the network. Double-check all inputs before confirming.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Create the Script File

1.  Log in to your Proxmox server's console (either physically or via SSH if you still have access).
2.  Use the `nano` text editor to create a new file.

    ```bash
    nano change-proxmox-ip.sh
    ```

3.  Copy the entire bash script from the section above and paste it into the `nano` editor.
4.  Save the file and exit by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and finally `Enter`.

#### Step 2: Make the Script Executable

You need to give the script permission to be executed.

```bash
chmod +x change-proxmox-ip.sh
```

#### Step 3: Run the Script

Execute the script with `sudo` to ensure it has the necessary root permissions to modify system files.

```bash
sudo ./change-proxmox-ip.sh
```

The script will then guide you through the rest of the process:

1.  It will first show you the IP address and gateway it detected.
2.  It will then prompt you to enter the new IP address with CIDR (e.g., `192.168.1.10/24`).
3.  Next, it will ask for the new gateway (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
4.  A summary of the intended changes will be displayed for your review.
5.  You must type `yes` to confirm and apply the changes.
6.  Finally, it will ask if you want to reboot. Type `yes` to restart the server with the new IP address.

After the reboot, your Proxmox server will be accessible on the new IP address you configured. Make sure your computer is connected to the same `192.168.1.0/24` network to access the web interface at `https://your-new-ip:8006`.
